# Docker Interactive Tutorial  

This is a fork of the [*previous*](https://github.com/dhrp/docker-tutorial) official Docker interative tutorial.  

Some content has been updated, a good bit removed, and files have been modified to be served statically.  

A docker image of this application is also [available here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jkohrman/docker-interactive).  To use that image, just open your terminal and enter:  

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 jkohrman/docker-tutorial  
```  

Then head to your browser and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to begin.
